{"name":"Easy2","body":"### Overview\r\neasy2 is a collection of scripts and configuration files that aid the process of building and booting custom machine images (AMIs) on Amazon EC2. \r\n\r\n### Installation and usage\r\nHere's how to install it. First, build and install the Debian package (on your EC2 instance):\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/minmb/easy2.git\r\n$ cd easy2\r\n$ debuild -us -uc\r\n$ sudo dpkg -i ../easy2*.deb\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, set `EC2_USER` and `EC2_GROUP` in `/etc/default/easy2` to the primary user/group for your AMI. Finally, run the init script:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/easy2 start\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe ´ssh-key´ start hook will query the EC2 metadata API and fetch and append the public SSH key specified at instance creation to `/home/$EC2_USER/.ssh/authorized_keys`. You may install your own start/stop hooks in `/etc/easy2/{start,stop}.d`.\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n* Martin Häger (@tmah)\r\n\r\n### License\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis package is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\r\n\r\nSee the GNU General Public License for more details.
